                                                              Hello World! (WAR-style)
==========================================================================================================================================================

This is the simple Java Application Project. In this Project, I have included the Jenkinsfile for CI-CD. This, Jenkinsfile clone's the sample hello-world java application code, performs unit test, performs build using maven tool, Analysis the Code using SonarQube and Deploy's the application into Tomcat. I have also setup feature which provides the slack notification if the build is successful or it has failed.
