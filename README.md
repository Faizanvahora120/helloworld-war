###                                                      Jenkinsfile for Java Hello-World App!
==========================================================================================================================================================

*This is the simple Java Application Project. In this Project, I have included the Jenkinsfile for CI-CD.*

## This, Jenkinsfile 

1. clone's the sample hello-world java application code.
2. performs unit test using mvn, performs build using maven tool
3. Analysis the Code using SonarQube and Deploy's the application into Tomcat. 
4. I have also setup feature which provides the slack notification if the build is successful or it has failed.
